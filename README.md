# JPX_Tokyo_Stock_Exchange_Prediction

In order to succeed in any financial market, one must first identify sound investments. It makes sense to buy when a stock or derivative is undervalued. If it's overpriced, it could be time to sell. While specialists used to make these financial judgments manually, technology has opened up new doors for retail investors. Quantitative trading, in which choices are made programmatically based on predictions from trained models, may be of interest to data scientists in particular.

## Data

The data and challenge was gotten from Kaggle: 

[jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/overview)

## Data Preprocessing and feature engineering
### Data cleaning 
Data cleaning and filling is a process that is used to clean up and fill in missing data in data sets. This process can be used to improve the accuracy of data sets, as well as to improve the efficiency of analysis processes. Missing values were fill with forward fill method. 


### New features
the original data includes essential indicators such as closing, open, high and low prices, as well as volume. With new features we introduce more sophisticated technical indicators:

Prices: 
- Prices lag: these are the prices with lag 1, i.e., from the previous day/period.

- RSI: relative strength index
- Log Return 
- SMA: simple moving average
- MACD: Moving Average Convergence/Divergence
- Volatility
